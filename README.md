# Chronic Disease Classification

This project builds a **machine learning model** to classify **chronic disease conditions** based on clinical and demographic health data. The goal is to explore how predictive modeling can support healthcare decision-making and early disease detection.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Early identification of chronic conditions can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare burdens.  
This project applies supervised learning techniques to classify individuals into different chronic disease categories.

### Key Objectives:
- Preprocess and analyze health dataset
- Compare multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics
- Interpret model outputs to inform healthcare insights

## 🧠 Machine Learning Methods Used

| Model Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Random Forest Classifier | Captures complex patterns in clinical data |
| Logistic Regression | Provides baseline statistical classification |

Evaluation metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- F1-Score
- Classification Report

## 📊 Results Summary

Performance varies between disease categories due to **class imbalance** in the dataset.  
Random Forest provides **higher predictive performance** compared to logistic regression.

Visualizations and detailed results are stored in the `reports/` folder.
